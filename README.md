## Overview

The **RestaurantsManagementSystem** is intended to provide a clean, maintainable backend system for restaurants — managing menus, orders, tables, possibly staff, etc. It is modularized with a Domain layer, Application layer, Infrastructure layer, and exposes its functionality via an API.

---

## Features

* CRUD operations for entities (Menu Items, Orders, Tables, Staff, etc.)
* Separation of concerns (domain, application logic, infrastructure)
* RESTful API endpoints
* Data persistence via an infrastructure layer
* Modular and testable code structure

*(Add more features as implemented: authentication, reporting, real-time updates, etc.)*

---

## Architecture

The repository is structured using a layered / clean architecture style:

| Layer              | Responsibility                                              |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Domain**         | Core business entities, domain logic, interfaces            |
| **Application**    | Application services, DTOs, business rules, use cases       |
| **Infrastructure** | Data access implementations, external services, persistence |
| **API**            | HTTP endpoints, controllers, request/response mapping       |

---

## Technologies

* C# / .NET (specify version, e.g. .NET 7 or .NET Core 6)
* (If used) Entity Framework / ORM
* (If used) SQL Server / PostgreSQL / other database
* (If used) Dependency Injection
* (If used) Automapper or similar mapping tools

---

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

* .NET SDK (version X.X)
* A supported database (SQL Server / PostgreSQL / etc.)
* Environment variables or config files set up
* (Optional) Docker, if there are containerization files

---

## Setup & Installation

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/ahmed18837/RestaurantsManagementSystem](https://github.com/sameh-elisha/restaurants-management-system).git
   cd RestaurantsManagementSystem
   ```

2. Restore dependencies

   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

3. Configure database connection string (see [Configuration](#configuration)).

4. Apply migrations / setup database

   ```bash
   dotnet ef database update --project Restaurants.Infrastructure
   ```

5. Run the API project

   ```bash
   dotnet run --project Restaurants.API
   ```

6. The API should now be available at e.g. `https://localhost:5001` (depending on config)

---

## Configuration

Some settings you’ll need to provide / adjust:

* Database connection string
* Environment (Development / Production)
* App settings (logging, CORS, etc.)
* Port / URLs for hosting

You can generally find these in `appsettings.json` / `appsettings.Development.json` or similar config files.

---

## Usage

Describe how to call the API endpoints. For example:

| Endpoint           | Method | Description       |
| ------------------ | ------ | ----------------- |
| `/api/menus`       | GET    | Get list of menus |
| `/api/orders`      | POST   | Create new order  |
| `/api/tables/{id}` | PUT    | Update table info |

*(Fill in actual endpoints once known)*

---

## Testing

If there are automated tests:

* How to run unit tests

  ```bash
  dotnet test
  ```
* Any integration tests
* Code coverage approach

---

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you want to contribute:

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/YourFeature`)
3. Make your changes
4. Add tests for them, if applicable
5. Submit a pull request describing what you changed and why

---

## License

State the license under which the project is released (e.g. MIT, Apache 2.0). If you haven’t picked one yet, you can add a `LICENSE` file.

---

If you like, I can generate a README tailored to exactly the code in the repo (e.g. endpoints, schema) by inspecting it. Do you want me to do that?
